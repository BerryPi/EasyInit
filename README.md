# EasyInit
A tool for Tabletop GMs to more easily determine initiative orders in encounters with multiple copies of an enemy.

## Usage
Have your players roll for initiative as normal.
When prompted, type in their names and the results of their rolls (after applying any bonuses)
Once all players have been entered in, press Enter at the prompt.
Now, enter the name of the enemy you want to add to your encounter, for example 'Guard' or 'Bandit', and their quantity.
The script will automatically roll a d20 for initiative for each one of the enemies, then display a list, sorted in descending order, of each character and their initiatives.
